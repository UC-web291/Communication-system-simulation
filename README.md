# Communication-system-simulation
Some simple communication system simulation, welcome star!
Existing projects:
1. OFDM+LABVIEW joint modulation system
It mainly includes: including signal generation (data modulation), OFDM modulation (IFFT, cyclic prefix), channel simulation (noise, fading), OFDM demodulation (FFT, prefix removal), data recovery (demodulation), performance analysis (bit error rate, etc.), and LABVIEW visual interface.
